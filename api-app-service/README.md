# API App Service

This folder contains the code for the API App Service, which implements the Circuit Breaker and Retry logic to handle incoming client requests and delegate tasks to the appropriate Azure Functions.

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Azure Subscription**: You must have an active Azure subscription.
- **GitHub Secrets**: Ensure that the necessary secrets are added to your GitHub repository.

## üîß Deployment Instructions

   Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

   - `AZURE_API_APP_NAME`: The name of your Azure API App Service.
   - `AZURE_API_APP_PUBLISH_PROFILE`: The publish profile for your Azure API App Service.

2. **Deploy API App Service**

   The deployment is automated using GitHub Actions. To deploy the API App Service:

   - **Trigger the GitHub Action**: Push changes to the `main` branch or manually trigger the `deploy-api-app-service.yml` workflow.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

- **Environment Variables**:

  Ensure that the following environment variables are set in the Azure portal for your App Service:
